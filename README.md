Module 3 Project

Create a program that can take numbers from two inputs, and has buttons for add, subtract, multiply, or divide operators.  

When numbers are entered into the input, the program should perform the desired operation when that button is clicked and output the result to the page.

TIP: if you use the input type="text" element, the type of the value of that input will be "string" not "number".  You will need to convert the value to a number in order to perform arithmetic operations.
